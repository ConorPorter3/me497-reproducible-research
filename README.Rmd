## reproducible research for the R novice

We explore the principles and practices of reproducible research, from gathering data to analyzing data and presenting results. Students implement a  workflow that includes file management, version control, literate programming, data carpentry, creating tables and graphs, and reporting---all within the context of producing reproducible technical reports.

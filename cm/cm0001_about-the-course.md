*What is reproducible research?*

Reproducible research is about explicitly linking a technical report,
paper, or talk to the software, scripts, and data files that generate
the findings.

Learn to write explicitly connected scripts to link your prose to the
computing that performs data carpentry and analysis, creates data
graphics and tables of results, and places the results directly in the
output document.

Cut and paste no more\!

*Why you?*

  - You know that your workflow is disorganized but you don’t know what
    to do about it  
  - You redo your analysis and graphs, and copy and paste them into a
    document—again and again  
  - You enjoy making software do your bidding and ultimately saving time
    over the life of a project

*Who benefits?*

  - Your future self  
  - Your collaborators  
  - Your organization

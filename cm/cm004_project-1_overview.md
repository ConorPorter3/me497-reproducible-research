project 1
=========

In this first project, you take a guided tour of creating a reproducible report.

-   The technical purpose of the work is to calibrate a force sensor and report the outcomes.
-   We begin by assuming our test lab has performed the requisite testing and has provided us two files: an image of the test setup, and a data set.
-   The tutorials lead you through the entire process from initial receipt of the data to final report for the client. As you work through the tutorials, you will be learning two software languages: R for computing and R Markdown for prose.
-   Your project is connected to a GitHub repository. Inviting me to be a collaborator on your repo makes it possible for me to review and comment on your work.

The project should be completed no later than the first day of week 3. Tasks include:

-   Create the project repo and invite me as a collaborator.
-   Complete all the tutorials
-   Push your files to GitHub as you proceed, making sure that all the git things are working before we get to project 2.
-   Look for a candidate project from your past work that would be suitable for project 2 and obtain my approval.

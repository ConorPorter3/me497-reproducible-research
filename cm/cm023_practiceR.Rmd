# start a new *practiceR* project 

```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(root.dir = "../")
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, collapse = TRUE)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
# functions for text_icon and code_icon
source("cm/helper_02_icons.R")
```


For tutorials for practicing and learning R, you might want to create a new R Project at the top level of your course directory called something like `practiceR`.  

Version control is not required.  This is your own personal project for writing scripts for learning R. 

```
overall-course-directory\
  |-- me497-project-1-YourLastName\
  |-- me497-project-2-YourLastName\
  `-- practiceR\
```

The `practiceR` directory starts out like this: 

```
practiceR\  
  |-- data\
  |-- scripts\
  |-- practiceR.Rproj
  `-- .Renviron
```

# start a new *practiceR* project

For tutorials for practicing and learning R, you might want to create a
new R Project at the top level of your course directory called something
like `practiceR`.

Version control is not required. This is your own personal project for
writing scripts for learning R.

    overall-course-directory\
      |-- me497-project-1-YourLastName\
      |-- me497-project-2-YourLastName\
      `-- practiceR\

The `practiceR` directory starts out like this:

    practiceR\  
      |-- data\
      |-- scripts\
      |-- practiceR.Rproj
      `-- .Renviron

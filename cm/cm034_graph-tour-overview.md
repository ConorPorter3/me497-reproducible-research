graph tour overview
===================

There are currently four graphical systems available in R:

-   `base` graphics, by Ross Ihaka, is included in every R installation
-   `grid` graphics, by Paul Murrell, provides low-level access to graphic primitives
-   `lattice`, by Deepayan Sarkar, excels at displaying multivariate data
-   `ggplot2`, by Hadley Wickham, is based on a comprehensive graphical "grammar"

I've used `lattice` for years now, but have recently started learning `ggplot2`. In my opinion, it's the package to learn; all the cool kids at the R conference are using it. Read more about `ggplot2` in section 10.4 of the text.

As you work through the tour, create a new script for each graph type in your `practiceR/scripts/` directory. I hope to be able to show you examples of these commonly encountered graph types:

-   Cleveland dot plot
-   histogram
-   box and whisker plot
-   scatter plot
-   time series
-   multiway plot

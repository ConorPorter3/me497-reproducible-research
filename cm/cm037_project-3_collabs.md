### action items

Alice and Carlos, the two partners, meet to agree on:

  - Who will be Alice and set up the initial repo
  - What the initial directory structure will be

Alice:

  - Creates a private project 3 repo
  - Clones the repo locally and starts setting up a directory structure
  - Invites the other team member as collaborator
  - Invites me (graphdr) to be a collaborator

Carlos:

  - Accepts the invitation
  - Clones the remote repo locally

Alice and Carlos:

  - Read the full [abstract online](cm031_project-3-descriptions.md) and
    the associated links.
  - Jointly draft the README.md for the repo. You may incorporate
    elements of my abstracts to start.
  - Begin planning your tasks for obtaining the data and starting the
    first script

## collaborators for review

Like we did in Project 2, each pair of you invites another pair to be
your collaborators for the purposes of checking the reproducibility of
your
project.

# wrap-up project 1 

When you think you are done, there are some last minute items to check. 

## scripts

- The F7 function button activates a spell-check. Check every script.  
- Set the `knitr` options to include `echo = TRUE` generally for work that does not go to a client. 
- Does each working script produce an HTML output that is error-free? 
- Does the script for the client report produce a DOCX output that is error free? 
- Other than document formatting (which we haven't addressed yet) is the report client worthy? 
- Have you run the scripts using the updated data set with 6 cycles instead of 3)? Does every output document correctly update when you do? 

## file management 

To make it easy for me to review your work, please ensure that your  `.gitignore` file includes: 

```
# ignore DOCX files 
*.docx
*/*.docx

# ignore HTML files
*.html
*/*.html

# ignore special  R files 
.Renviron
.Rhistory
.RData

# ignore a hidden RStudio directory
.Rproj.user/

# ignore the RStudio project file 
*.Rproj
```

Once your `.gitignore` file is up to date, you should: 

- Delete all HTML and DOCX files from your project directories. 
- Stage/Commit/Push your changes to the GitHub repo. 

Great! You're done.

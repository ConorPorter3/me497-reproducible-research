=================

review and response summaries
-----------------------------

The README should contain two summaries.

**Summary by the reviewing group**

-   Having pulled the most recent version of the project, were you able to successfully run every script in order? Did everything compile correctly?
-   If not, were you able to review errors and make a correction or a suggestion?
-   Comment on the project files and scripts guided by the [Comprehensive checklist for reproducibility](http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/checklist/)
-   Compile each script, one at a time, read the HTML output document. Do you follow the authors' reasoning? Does the analysis make sense? Is the logic of their argument clear? Is every assertion supported by evidence that you find credible? Did you find any part of the argument ambiguous?
-   Make comments and suggestions on the code and the prose in the scripts you review to help the authors improve their work.
-   Remember to Stage/Commit/Pull/Push.

**Summary by the author group**

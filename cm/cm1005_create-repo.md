# create a repo

You should already have done the following

  - Installed git locally
  - Obtained a free GitHub account
  - Practiced creating a test repo

## project 1

  - Create a repo called `project-1-last-first`, replacing `last` with
    your last name (family name or surname) and `first` with your first
    name (given name or forename)
  - Make the repo private
  - Check the box to *Initialize this repository with a README*
  - Pulldown the *Add gitignore* menu to *R*
  - A license is optional (private repos for classwork donâ€™t generally
    need a license)
  - *Create repository*

## additional repos

It is helpful to me if all the class repos are created at the same time.

Repeat the instructions above to create repos called

  - `practice-work-last-first`
  - `project-2-last-first`
  - `project-3-last-first` (597 students
only)

<!-- Invite me to be your collaborator  -->

<!-- - In the repo, click on the `Settings` icon.  -->

<!-- - Click on the `Collaborators` tab  -->

<!-- - In the `Search by username` box, type my GitHub name `graphdr`, click `Add collaborator` to add me as a collaborator to your project  -->

<!-- In the repo main page, click `Clone or download` and copy that URL. We'll use it below.   -->

<!-- ## create a new project with version control  -->

<!-- In RStudio, create a new project:  -->

<!-- - RStudio *File > New Project > Version control > Git*  -->

<!-- - In the dialog  box, paste the repo URL, and edit the path so that the new project is a sub-directory of your course folder.  -->

<!-- Check your course folder. It should now contain a folder `me497-project-1-yourLastName`.  -->

<!-- Inside the `me497-project-1-yourLastName`folder you should find  -->

<!-- - `me497-project-1-yourLastName.Rproj`   -->

<!-- - `.gitignore`    -->

<!-- - `README.md`   -->

<!-- ## setup the project directory tree -->

<!-- In your project directory, create new folders (sub-directories) for `data\`, `reports\`, `resources\`, `results\`, and `scripts\`. Earlier you created a `.Renviron` file. Save a copy  in the project folder.  -->

<!-- Your directory should look like this:  -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- me497-project-1-YourLastName\ -->

<!--   |-- data\ -->

<!--   |-- manage\ -->

<!--   |-- reports\ -->

<!--   |-- resources\ -->

<!--   |-- results\ -->

<!--   |-- scripts\ -->

<!--   |-- me497-project-1-YourLastName.Rproj -->

<!--   |-- .Renviron -->

<!--   |-- .gitignore -->

<!--   `-- README.md -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Over time, of course, you will settle on you own approach to file organization. For this project, we'll all use this one.  -->

# first steps in collaborating via GitHub

The way we are using version control for collaboration, we get four primary benefits: 

- Reproducing one another's work 
- Reviewing and commenting on one another's changes 
- Resolving conflicts 
- Revert to an earlier version of a file 





## assignment 

I will be your first collaborator. Navigate to one of your GitHub project repos and 

1. Select the *Settings* tab 
2. Select the *Collaborators* menu 
3. In the *Search by user name* box, type my GitHub name, "graphdr" 
4. *Add Collaborator* 
5. Repeat for all your projects 



```{r}
include_graphics("../resources/images/github-collaborate-2.png")
```







## git jargon   

<!-- - "clone" a project from a remote repo to a local directory  -->
- *commit* to record changes  locally 
<!-- - "conflict" when author and collaborator change the same line of the script at the same time  -->
- *gitignore* lists local files excused from version control and therefore not shared with collaborators 
- *history* illustrates commits by everyone
- *local* is your personal computer 
- *pull* to fetch files from GitHub and merge with your local version of the project 
- *push* to send committed changes to the remote repo 
- *remote* is the GitHub server 
<!-- - "revert" to recover an earlier version of a file  -->
- *stage* to select files to commit locally 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/git-stage-commit-push-pull.png")
```




## the collaboration cast  

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/alice-thumbnail.jpg")
```
**Alice** is the Author, the owner of the repository. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/carlos-thumbnail.jpg")
```
**Carlos** is the Collaborator whom Alice invited to join her repo. 

At the start of your first project, Carlos is me (Richard Layton). Later, each of you will be Carlos to a classmate's Alice.

## alice  

Alice has created a repo and sent a collaboration invitation to Carlos. Once Carlos accepts the invitation, he may have edited or commented some of the work. 

**When you start a project work session**

-  *Pull* before doing additional work 

When you pull, you might get a message like this one,

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/stage-before-pull.png")
```

If you get such a message, 

- *Stage* and *Commit* locally 
- *Pull* in case Carlos made changes in the last few minutes 
- If you spent any time resolving conflicts (we'll discuss this later) *Pull* again 
- *Push* 

**When you conclude a project work session**

- Add to the *gitignore* file for files and directories you want excused from version control and therefore not shared with collaborators 
- *Stage* and *Commit* locally
- *Pull* in case Carlos made changes during your session 
- Optionally check *History* to see changes 
- *Push* to GitHub so that your latest edits are available to Carlos

# invite a GitHub collaborator

The way we are using version control for collaboration, we get four
primary benefits:

  - Reproducing one another’s work
  - Reviewing and commenting on one another’s changes
  - Resolving conflicts
  - Revert to an earlier version of a file

## assignment

I will be your first collaborator. Navigate to one of your GitHub
project repos and

1.  Select the *Settings* tab
2.  Select the *Collaborators* menu
3.  In the *Search by user name* box, type my GitHub name, “graphdr”
4.  *Add Collaborator*
5.  Repeat for all your projects

# stage-commit-pull-push

We treat the repo as the master version of a project. 

The basic steps when collaborating via GitHub are to work locally, stage your edits and commit them, pull from the repo in case your collaborator has pushed changes, merge the changes with your own, then push to the repo. 




## git jargon   

<!-- - "clone" a project from a remote repo to a local directory  -->
- *commit* to record changes  locally 
<!-- - "conflict" when author and collaborator change the same line of the script at the same time  -->
- *gitignore* lists local files excused from version control and therefore not shared with collaborators 
- *history* illustrates commits by everyone
- *local* is your personal computer 
- *pull* to fetch files from GitHub and merge with your local version of the project 
- *push* to send committed changes to the remote repo 
- *remote* is the GitHub server 
<!-- - "revert" to recover an earlier version of a file  -->
- *stage* to select files to commit locally

## the collaboration cast  

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/alice-thumbnail.jpg")
```
**Alice** is the Author, the owner of the repository. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/carlos-thumbnail.jpg")
```
**Carlos** is the Collaborator whom Alice invited to join her repo. 

At the start of your first project, Carlos is me (Richard Layton). Later, each of you will be Carlos to a classmate's Alice.

## alice  

Alice has created a repo and sent a collaboration invitation to Carlos. Once Carlos accepts the invitation, he may have edited or commented some of the work. 

**When you start a project work session**

-  *Pull* before doing additional work 

When you pull, you might get a message like this one,

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../resources/images/stage-before-pull.png")
```

If you get such a message, 

- *Stage* and *Commit* locally 
- *Pull* in case Carlos made changes in the last few minutes 
- If you spent any time resolving conflicts (we'll discuss this later) *Pull* again 
- *Push* 

**When you conclude a project work session**

- Add to the *gitignore* file for files and directories you want excused from version control and therefore not shared with collaborators 
- *Stage* and *Commit* locally
- *Pull* in case Carlos made changes during your session 
- Optionally check *History* to see changes 
- *Push* to GitHub so that your latest edits are available to Carlos 



## assignment 

Open one of your projects  

- Select the *Git* tab 


If there are files shown in the Git pane, 

- Click your cursor in the *git* pane 
- Select all the files using the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl A* (*Command A* in the Mac OS) 
- Stage all files by clicking in one of the *Staged* boxes 
- Select *Commit* 
- In the text box, write a short but descriptive message that summarizes the nature of the commit 
- *Commit* 
- *Pull* and you will see the message *Current branch master is up to date* (assuming Carlos has not yet made any changes) 
- *Close* 
- *Push* 
- *Close* 

Navigate to your online repo and you should find that it includes all your changes. 

- Repeat for all your projects.

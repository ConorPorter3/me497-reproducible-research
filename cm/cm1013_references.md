# references and citations

We will use the bib format (from BiBTeX) for bibliographies. The basic
steps are:

  - create the bib file  
  - specify the bib file in the YAML header of the Rmd script
  - add the citation to the report  
  - add a references heading

See the [lecture notes](cm5011_references.md) for how to manage
references and citations.

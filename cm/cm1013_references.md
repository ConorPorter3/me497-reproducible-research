# references and citations

We will use the bib format (from BiBTeX) for bibliographies. The basic
steps are:

  - create the bib file  
  - specify the bib file in the YAML header of the Rmd script
  - add the citation to the report  
  - add a references heading

## create the bib file

To create the bib file:

  - Open a new text file in RStudio, *File \> New File \> Text File*  
  - *Save As* `project_name.bib` in the `resources` directory

You will type references into the `.bib` file something like this,

<pre class="r"><code>@manual{ansi-isa-1995,
    title        = {Process instrumentation terminology},
    edition      = {ANSI/ISA-S51.1-1979, reaffirmed 1995},
    organization = {Instrument Society of America},
    address      = {Research Triangle Park, NC},
    year         = {1995},
    note         = {ISBN 0-87664-390-4},
}</code></pre>

  - `ansi-isa-1995` is a reference label you assign here to be used
    later in the citation  
  - `@manual` denotes the document type using standard BiBTeX syntax.

For help in formatting the entries in the bib file by article type,
e.g., article, proceedings, book, manual, etc., try the
[verbosus](https://verbosus.com/bibtex-style-examples.html) site.

## specify the bib file in the YAML header

Add the bibliography argument to the front matter including the relative
path if needed.

<pre class="r"><code>---
title: "Load-cell calibration report"
author: "name"
date: "date"
output: word_document
bibliography: "../resources/project_name.bib"
---</code></pre>

## add the citation to the report

In the report Rmd file, add the citation at the appropriate location in
the paragraph, for
example,

<pre class="r"><code>The test procedure follows the ANSI/ISA standard [@ansi-isa-1995]. 
</code></pre>

The citation syntax has the form `[@ref_label]`

  - `[ ]` a citation is delimited with square brackets
  - `@ref_label` the `@` symbol followed by the reference label you
    assigned in the bib file

## add a references heading

At the end of the Rmd script, add a references section heading.

<pre class="r"><code># References
</code></pre>

All references cited in your report will be automatically formatted and
listed here, at the end of the report.

## changing the format

Citations and references are both formatted automatically. To change the
format, we use a CSL file. You donâ€™t have to create one. Just find the
one that meets your needs online and download it.

  - Find a [CSL style file](http://citationstyles.org/styles/) that
    suits your needs, for example `chicago-author-date.csl` or
    `ieee.csl`
  - Download the CSL file and save it in your `resources/` folder  
  - Edit the YAML header to designate the CSL style file you wish to
    use.

<pre class="r"><code>---
title: "Load-cell calibration report"
author: "name"
date: "date"
output: word_document
bibliography: "../resources/project_name.bib"
csl: "../resources/chicago-author-date.csl"
---</code></pre>

References are sometimes not capitalized the way you expect. Return to
the `.bib` file and place braces `{}` around letters you want
capitalized.

For example,

    @book{gandrud2015,
      author    = {Christopher Gandrud}, 
      title     = {Reproducible {R}esearch with {R} and {RS}tudio},
      publisher = {CRC Press},
      year      = {2015},
      address   = {Boca Raton, FL},
      edition   = {2},
    }

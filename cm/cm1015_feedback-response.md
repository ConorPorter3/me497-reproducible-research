# responding to project feedback

Once I have reviewed and comments on your project work to date, I will
push the edited files to GitHub and send you an email letting you know
they are avcailable.

Make sure that when next you open the project, you *Pull* from GitHub
before doing any further work.

## project 1

General comments

  - Start work on the [README](cm1012_edit-readme.md)

  - docx files can typically be excused from version control using
    [gitignore](cm1009_gitignore.md)

General comments

  - For guidance propsals generally, have a look at
    <https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/technicalwriting/chapter/7-1/>.
  - Proposals have to be specific. You are trying to convince your
    reader to authorize your work.
  - For the week 6 progress report, describe the data, analysis, and
    results specifically.
  - If your work has important references you are using, put PDFs in
    your reources folder.
